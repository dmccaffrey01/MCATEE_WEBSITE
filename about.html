                        My name is Kylyna. I am a proud Ukrainian-American real estate professional.

                        As someone who has lived all over the State of Maryland, I proudly represent the area I know
                        most which is Howard County. I love being in real estate because personal relationship building
                        is the essence of being a great realtor. I feel most successful when my clients are happy. Not
                        only am I a licensed real estate sales agent, but I have pursued a degree in Business and
                        American Sign Language. Because of my academic background in ASL, I strive to be an ally of the
                        Deaf community during the home buying process and being an strong advocate for all. As I was
                        personally impacted by the 2008 mortgage crisis, I take the home buying process very seriously.
                        For my buyers, I am relentless about finding them the right home. For my sellers, I am
                        passionate about getting the right price.
